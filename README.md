# Thesis Template

Original template sourced from: https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/thesis-template-for-university-of-strathclyde/nfnrnmjqyxqg

Additional features:
- `\code{}` can be used to insert an inline code snippet.
- `lstlisting` contains a colour template, code lines, etc.
- Changed to use biblatex instead of bibtex. You can use either but they are all a pain in the backside.
- Additional packages that help with math equations.
